## Think About

  - [Riders of Apocalypse](Riders_of_Apocalypse.md)
  - [Black Jack](Black_Jack.md)
    - Small black dragon
- Mechanical (multi-unit) hero
- Good heal / buff support
- Make sure team-fights take some time
  - The game should be slower then [Dota 2](http://dota2.com/) or [LoL](https://leagueoflegends.com/)
  - All abilities / heroes should feel like having impact
